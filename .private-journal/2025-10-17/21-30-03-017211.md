## Project Notes

**Replaceable Events Implementation - Complete Status:**

✅ **VideoEventService**: Full NIP-33 replaceable event handling implemented and tested
- Tracks events by (subscriptionType, kind, pubkey, d-tag) tuple
- Compares timestamps, keeps newer, removes older
- 5 comprehensive tests passing
- Works for kinds 34235, 34236 (parameterized replaceable)

✅ **ProfileCacheService**: ALREADY has proper replaceable event handling!
- `updateCachedProfile()` method compares `createdAt` timestamps
- Only updates if newer version arrives
- Logs warnings when skipping older versions
- Works for kind 0 (profile events)

✅ **NostrService**: Fixed replaceable event handling (previous session)
- Proper NIP-01, NIP-16, NIP-33 compliance
- Fixed profile update bug

**Next**: Check if video_event_cache_service and personal_event_cache_service need similar logic.
