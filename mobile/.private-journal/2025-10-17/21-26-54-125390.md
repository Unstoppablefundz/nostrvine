## Project Notes

Video display bug resolved! The issue Rabble reported ("something changed and now i don't see any videos") was caused by type errors introduced in commit ab81b36 which added NIP-33 replaceable event support.

The bug manifested as:
- Home feed showing 0 videos despite receiving events from relay
- "Failed to parse video event" errors in logs
- App rebuilding home screen 5 times without success

The fix required three edits across the codebase to add explicit type annotations to `orElse` callbacks. After fixes, videos load perfectly - 100 videos showing in both Popular Now and Trending tabs.

**Important Pattern**: When using `firstWhere` or `maybeWhen` with orElse, ALWAYS use explicit types: `() => <Type>[]` not just `() => []`
